To do so, simply open app.js, and go to the part declaring "var allFeeds". Then, you can change your feeds by adding(or modifying) the name of the new website you want to follow by typing it after "name :" , and add the full url of the feed after the "url :". Remember the names and url must be typed inside quotes. As follows:

    var allFeeds = [
         {
            name: 'Name Website number 1',
            url: 'https://www.website_i_follow.com/articles/feed'
